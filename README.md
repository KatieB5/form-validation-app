# Introduction
I recently worked on a client project to build an interactive and responsive frontend UI for an intelligent quoting app, as part of my day job. Unfortunately, I couldn't share the project or continue working on it after leaving the company, so I decided to rebuild something similar! This would allow me to get more practice with the tech stack, tools and libraries as 3/5 of those used in the client project were new to me.

Tech stack for previous client project: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, zod, and shadcn/ui.

Tech stack for this project: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, zod, and shadcn/ui.

I've used Next.js instead of React in case I want to deploy this project and take it further than just being a dev frontend UI ðŸ™ƒ
